# 📘 Lixlib Docs

**Lixlib Docs** is the documentation MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for **Threed Software’s Lix App components**.
It serves as a foundational prototype and proof of concept for what will later become the official documentation site for the Lix app.

---

## 🌱 About the Project

Before diving into full-scale web development, this MVP was built to test the structure, design, and flow of a documentation site.
It provides a space to visualize how Lix app component documentation could be organized and presented — helping guide the direction of the upcoming full website.

This project stands as both a **working model** and a **temporary documentation hub**, ensuring that development and communication could continue smoothly during the early stages of Lix’s creation.

---

## 💡 Motivation

The main goal was to **create a functional and accessible documentation platform quickly** — one that developers and early collaborators could refer to while the official site was still in development.
Think of it as a bridge between concept and completion — something tangible that keeps the project moving forward.

---

## 👥 Audience

Lixlib Docs was designed with two key audiences in mind:

* **Developers** — to understand, test, and implement Lix app components.
* **General users and stakeholders** — to get a clear picture of the project’s direction and functionality.
