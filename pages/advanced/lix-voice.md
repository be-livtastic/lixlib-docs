## Installation

To install **Lix Voice** on your website and start capturing voice
input:

1.  **Add to Site:**

    -   Open your website in the Wix Editor.
    -   Go to the **App Market**, search for \"Lix Voice,\" and click on
        \"Add to Site.\"
    -   Select the website you wish to enhance with voice commands if
        you manage multiple sites.

2.  **Place Lix Voice on Your Page:**

    -   Once installed, go to the **Elements** tab, locate Lix Voice,
        and add it to your homepage or any other page where you'd like
        users to access voice commands.
    -   Lix Voice will automatically adopt your site\'s theme, but you
        can also customize its appearance to align with your website\'s
        design.

3.  **Language and Speech Settings:**

    -   Set your initial language by selecting **English** or any other
        preferred language in the Lix Voice settings. You can modify
        this language setting at any time to accommodate multilingual
        support.

4.  **Testing Voice Recognition:**

    -   Publish your site to ensure the app is fully functional. Open
        the site in a new tab, and you should see the Lix Voice icon.
    -   Grant microphone access when prompted, and test by speaking
        commands or phrases. Confirm that the spoken text is accurately
        displayed on your site.

5.  **Utilize Captured Text with JavaScript (Optional for Custom
    Interactions):**

    -   Enable **Dev Mode** in the Wix Editor to access coding
        capabilities.
    -   Use JavaScript to interact with the captured voice text:
        -   Find the Lix Voice element's ID (e.g., `#voiceCore1`).
        -   Add the following code in Dev Mode:

**FOR EXAMPLE**

       ```javascript
       $w("#voiceCore1").onResponse((event) => {
           console.log(event.data); // Logs the voice input
           // Use event.data to handle specific commands or actions
       });
       ```
     - Publish your changes and test by speaking into the Lix Voice tool. The spoken input should appear in the console log.

## Usage

To enable voice recognition on your website:

1.  **Set Up Voice Recognition:**

    -   Add a text element to your page and take note of its ID.
    -   Use the Wix code panel to create a script that listens for voice
        input, populating the text element as users speak.

2.  **Build Voice-Powered Forms:**

    -   After testing, replace the text element with a Wix form
        containing input fields.
    -   Use an \"on click\" listener to determine which input field is
        active.
    -   Capture voice input and apply it directly to the active input
        field, streamlining user interaction.

3.  **Test and Publish:**

    -   Publish your site to a live environment.
    -   Verify that the voice-powered form works accurately and test for
        any updates in real-time voice input and field population.
